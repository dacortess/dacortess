# Hello! I'm David 👋  

## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a Computer Science student who likes solving problems that probably didn’t exist before I started coding. I have a deep passion for automation, algorithms, and data science, basically anything that makes computers do the work while I take the credit.

📍 Based in Bogotá, Colombia, but available in all time zones thanks to my nocturnal coding habits.
